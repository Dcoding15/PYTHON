Different data type holds different size of data.
	-2^(n) to +2^(n-1)		where n is no. of bits

byte = 7 bits + 1 significant bit
short = 15 bits + 1 significant bit
int = 31 bits + 1 significant bit
long = 63 bits + 1 significant bit
boolean = 1 significant bit

We can represent values in multiple ways: -
1. Binary Form (base 2 i.e., 0 1) (Prefix 0b or 0B) (bin() function)
2. Octal Form (base 8 i.e., 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (Prefix 0o or 0O) (oct() function)
3. Decimal Form (base 10 i.e., 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) (No prefix)
4. Hexadecimal Form (base 16 i.e., 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) (Prefix 0x or 0X) (hex() function)
5. Bytes: For byte b''

According to IEEE 754 : -
float (single precesion) = 1 significant bit + 8 exponent bits + 23 mantissa bits
double (double precision) = 1 significant bit + 11 exponent bits + 52 mantissa bits

Exponential form --> 21e2 is 21 * 10^2, e is replced with { * 10^ }

Note: In Python address will be same of int() from -5 to 256, str() [ all characters ], bool() & None.


Encoding: The process of conversion of data from one format to another format is known as encoding. So, there are two type of encoding: -
			1) Character encoding (Encodes character into bytes)
					(1) HTML Encoding
					(2) URL Encoding
					(3) Unicode Encoding
					(4) Base64 Encoding
					(5) Hex Encoding
					(6) ASCII Encoding
			2) Image, Audio & Video encoding
