Machine Learning = Code + Data -> Algorithm

Types of Machine Learning: -
    1. Supervised           (problem has both input and output column)
        a. Regression       (output column is numerical)
        b. Classification   (output column is categorical)
    2. Unsupervised                     (problem has only input column)
        a. Clustering                   (input column is grouped on various categories)
        b. Dimensionality Reduction     (input column is grouped into reduced columns)
        c. Anamoly Detection            (input column is detected large difference between amooung its data)
        d. Association Rule Learning    (input column has between its data)   
    3. Semisupervised   (problem has labeled input column)
    4. Reinforcement    (problem has agent learn through negative and positive rewards and updating its own policies)
    5. Instance Based Learning  (remembering each time when learning something new except learning rule)
    6. Model Based Learning     (learning rule or generalising each time when learning something new instead of remembering or storing data)

Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDC): -
    1. Frame the problem - check which type of learning is best.
    
    2. Gathering data - fetch data through web scraping, json api, csv file, data warehouse from running data base, etc.
    
    3. Data Preprocessing - modify format of fetched data to make compatiable with machine learning model.
    4. Exploratry Data Analysis - study relationship between input and output data.
    
    5. Feature Engineering and Selection - selection or removing of some input data to make better 
    learning model performance.
    
    6. Model Training, Evaluation and Selection - training and evaluating model using various ML algorithm. Selecting best algorithm for that specific models
    
    7. Model Deployment
    
    8. Testing
    
    9. Optimizing
