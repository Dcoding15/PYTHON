Machine Learning = Code + Data -> Algorithm

Types of Machine Learning: -
    1. Supervised           (problem has both input and output column)
        a. Regression       (output column is numerical)
        b. Classification   (output column is categorical)
    2. Unsupervised                     (problem has only input column)
        a. Clustering                   (input column is grouped on various categories)
        b. Dimensionality Reduction     (input column is grouped into reduced columns)
        c. Anamoly Detection            (input column is detected large difference between amooung its data)
        d. Association Rule Learning    (input column has between its data)   
    3. Semisupervised   (problem has labeled input column)
    4. Reinforcement    (problem has agent learn through negative and positive rewards and updating its own policies)
    5. Instance Based Learning  (remembering each time when learning something new except learning rule)
    6. Model Based Learning     (learning rule or generalising each time when learning something new instead of remembering or storing data)
