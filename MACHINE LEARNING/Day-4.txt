Feature Enginnering: -
-------------------
    1. The process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data.
    2. It is used to improve machine learning algorithm.
    3. Types of feature enginnering: -
        a. Feature Transformation - missing values impuation, handling categorical features, outlier detection, feature scaling
        b. Feature Construction
        c. Feature Selection
        d. Feature Extraction

Feature Scaling: -
---------------
    1. It is a technique to standardise the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.
    2. There are two of feature scaling: -
        a. Standardisation (z-score normalisation): -
            x' = ( x[i] - mean(x) ) / standard_deviation(x)
            where, x is numerical column of a data set
            Range: -1 to 1
        b. Normalisation: -
            xi' = (xi - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
            where, x is numerical column of a data set
            Range: 0 to 1

Types of Encoding: -
-----------------
    1. Nominal Encoding (consider numerical data)
        a. One Hot Encoding
        b. One Hot Encoding with many categories
        c. Mean Encoding
    2. Ordinal Encoding (consider ranking data)
        a. Label Encoding
        b. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding
