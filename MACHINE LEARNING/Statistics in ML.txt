Statistics: It is a discipline that concerns the collection, organisation, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.
2 types of statistics: -
	1. Descriptive Statistics
		a. Analyzing, summarizing, organizing data in the form of number and graph
    	b. Bar plot, Histogram, Pie chart, PDF (Probability Density Function), CDF (Cumulative Density Function)
		c. Measure of Central Tendency i.e. Mean, Median, Mode
		d. Measure of Variance
	2. Infernal Statistics
		a. Taking sample from entire population, then we try to do some test and we make a decision of against that sample data.
		b. Test like Z Test, T Test, Chi2 Test, etc.

Population vs Sample: -
	1. Population (A group of thing share a common characteristics)
	2. Sample (Part of some population)
	3. Random Variable
		a. Discreate Random Variable (variable takes finite no. of values)
		b. Continuous Random Variable (varialble takes infinite no. of values within a given interval)
	4. Gaussian Distribution / Normal Distribution
		a. gaussian_distribution(mean(x), standard_deviation(x))
		b. It will form bell curve graph as output. The highest point refers to mean of the dataset.
		c. Empirical rule also know as 68-95-99.7 rule or 3 sigma rule. It is used to calculate the percentage of data that falls within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean.
			i. 68% for mean(x) - standard_deviation(x) <= x <= mean(x) + standard_deviation(x)
			ii. 95% for mean(x) - 2*standard_deviation(x) <= x <= mean(x) + 3*standard_deviation(x)
			iii. 99.7% for mean(x) - 3*standard_deviation(x) <= x <= mean(x) + 3*standard_deviation(x)
