# Definition: Binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.

# Logistic Funtion - Sigmoid Function: -
# 	1. Range of dependent variable is from 0 to 1 (y-axis).
# 	2. Range of independent variable is from -inf to inf (x-axis).
# 	3. Used only two dependent variable. We use softmax function if there are more than two variable.

# Assumptions: -
# 	1. No correlation between input variables.
# 	2. Only two dependent variable allowed.
# 	3. Linear relationship between independent variable and log odds of dependent variable.
# 	4. No outliers in datasets.
# 	5. Large sample size.
