Aim: This regression model is to handle overfitting of linear regression model with resepect to trained data

Overfitting model	-> high accuracy on training dataset and low accuracy on test dataset.
Underfitting model	-> low accuracy on training dataset and low accracy on test dataset.
Generalised model	-> high accuracy on training dataset and low accuracy on test dataset.

Ridge Regression (L2 Regularisation): ((h_theta(x_i) - y_i) ** 2) + lambda*(slope ** 2)
