Polymorphism: -
------------

    1. Poly means many and morphism means form. It means one thing have the ability to display many form.
    2. There are two types of polymophism: -
        (a) Overloading
            i)  Operator overloading: -
                --------------------
                Same operator but different purposes.

                + operator: -
                ----------
                    10 + 20       ===> Addition
                    'abc' + 'def' ===> String Concatenation
                
                * operator: -
                ----------
                    10 * 20        ===> Multiplication
                    'abc' * 10     ===> String Multiplication

                Note: We have to explicitly overiding operator using dunder or magic method at time of using objects.

            ii) Method overloading
            iii) Constructor overloading
        (b) Overrinding
            i) Method overriding
            ii) Constructor overriding
